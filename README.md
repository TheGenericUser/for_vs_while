# for_vs_while
The programs makes two files.
Then it starts a big loop(for) which contains two other loops. One is for while and the other is for loop.
It captures the time it took to for the loops to print till 1,000,000 and then append the results to the two files opened at the start. 
One file is for the time it took for the loops to finish the count and the other gives the difference between the two loops.[W-F]
The whole loop runs for 250 turns.
